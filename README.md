# Wistia Front-end Engineer Coding Exercise

## Overview
Employees at Wistia are encouraged to apply our [values](https://wistia.com/about/values) in everything we do.  As an engineer on our team, you'll be using these values to bring beautiful, accessible, responsive designs to life for our brand and product marketing pages.

We're a collaborative company, and you'll be working closely with the designers on the team.  Though this exercise can't quite capture a true collaborative experience, we'd like you to keep this in mind during the course of this exercise.  Take note of any questions or suggestions you may have for a designer, or any tradeoffs or assumptions you make and make sure to include them in the writeup with your submission.

We use an iterative design process that starts with simple sketches and wireframes and moves to more advanced mockups or clickable prototypes.  We solicit feedback from various stakeholders (including the developers) along the way.  For the purpose of this exercise, you'll be working from a mockup of a Jobs page we'd like to build, and the designer has provided the mockups and other assets required for the page.

## Must Haves

- The page must be fully responsive and accessible
- A clear writeup
    - We put a high value on communication and collaboration.  You'll be working alone, but capture observations, questions, assumptions, and tradeoffs in a writeup that you include with your submission.  Help us understand how you approached the problem
- A link to your github repo or a zip file with your final solution
    - We love to see intermediate work, so we'd prefer a link to a repo

## Getting Started

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
4. Check out http://localhost:3000/wistia-assets to see a page in action.
5. http://localhost:3000/jobs is the page that you'll be building.
6. When you are done, send us your submission

## Things to note

- Ensure the page is fully responsive and accessible.
- The only browser it needs to render 100% correctly in is the latest Chrome.
- As you can tell, this repo pulls lots of stuff from wistia.com, so many of the components, patterns, and utils you see here is part of what's live in production and what you'll be working with.
- We use [BEM class](http://getbem.com/naming/) names.

## Assets and Components

- pages design is at `./jobs-design.jpg`
- page image assets are in `/static/images`
- colors can be found in `/utils/colors.js`
- a set of React components in `/components`
- icons are in componentized SVG form in `/components/icons`

## Questions

We want you to do your best work, so if you have any questions or run into problems, reach out to the hiring manager and we'll try to get you pointed in the right direction.
