## Process Notes

Long-term Company Thinking

Creativity

#### Simplicity

- I've decided to add each section of the page under `components/content` so `pages/jobs` is simplified

#### Presentation

- `copy.js` allows devs to quickly swap copy if the message requires changing (i.e. a/b testing proves content A over content B)
