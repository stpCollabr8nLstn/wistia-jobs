# Wistia Front-end Marketing Engineer Code Test

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
5. Check out http://localhost:3000/wistia-assets to see a page in action.
6. http://localhost:3000/jobs is the page that you'll be building.
7. [TODO] When you're complete...


## Things to note

- Ensure the page is fully responsive and accessible. The only browser it needs to render 100% correctly in is the latest Chrome.
- As you can tell, this repo pulls lots of stuff from wistia.com, so many of the components, patterns, and utils you see here is part of what's live in production and what you'll be working with.
- We use [BEM class](http://getbem.com/naming/) names.
- Feel free to leave a README or inline comments with any decisions you made that were worth noting, anyting that you learned or would do differently if doing this again, and any other notes you think are relevant.

### Assets

- pages design is at `./jobs-design.jpg`
- page image assets are in `/static/images`
- icons are in componentized SVG form in `/components/icons`
- colors can be found in `/utils/colors.js`
